# Netflix Content Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project involves building a **content-based recommendation system** for Netflix movies and TV shows using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system leverages the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization method to compare movie descriptions and make recommendations. 

The goal is to recommend movies or TV shows to users based on the similarity of the descriptions, enabling personalized content suggestions.

## Business Objective

The purpose of this recommendation system is to improve user experience by providing relevant and personalized content suggestions based on movie/TV show descriptions. By analyzing textual data, the system helps users discover movies or shows that are similar to what they've watched or searched for previously, based on their preferences.

## Features

1. **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of non-alphabetic characters, stop words, and unnecessary spaces from movie descriptions.
   - Standardization of text data to lowercase for uniformity in analysis.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - Utilizes TF-IDF to convert the movie descriptions into numerical features that can be compared.
   - The TF-IDF vectorizer helps capture the importance of words in the context of each movie or show.

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Computes the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of different movies and TV shows to measure how similar they are.
   - This similarity score is used to recommend content that is most similar to the input movie/show description.

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Based on the calculated similarities, the system generates a list of recommended movies and TV shows for the user.
   
5. **Data Visualization**:
   - WordCloud visualization of the most frequent words in the descriptions.
   - Distribution graphs for genres, ratings, and release years to understand trends in the dataset.

## Impact

- **Improved User Experience**: By providing personalized content recommendations, the system helps users easily discover new movies and TV shows based on their interests.
- **Efficient Discovery**: The content-based approach ensures that users find content similar to what they enjoy, reducing the time spent searching for new titles.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Visualizations provide a deeper understanding of genre distributions, release year trends, and popular keywords, aiding Netflix in refining content strategies.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - WordCloud

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of Netflix movies and TV shows, including information like the title, description, genre, release year, and rating. You can use a publicly available dataset from sources like Kaggle or create your own dataset using Netflixâ€™s API.
